# CSE 210 Group 10 Project Repository - ByteBoard

## Project Overview
This repository contains work done by CSE 210 Team 10 for the Fall 2024 Quarter Final Project: ByteBoard. After initial design exploration, the team decided to develop a dashboard focused on student developers. Through extensive research, the team found a lack of developer dashboards that specifically focused on students. A student user persona has unique requirements that do not fit the paradigms of a traditional developer dashboard. As such, a specialized dashboard could give student developers the boost in productivity they need. See the [pitch document](https://github.com/CSE-210-Team-10/cse210-group10/blob/main/spec/CSE210_Team10_Pitch.pdf) for more information.

## Features
This implementation focused on features that student developers would find useful. This was found through iteration and feedback from potential users. A final list of features can be seen below:
- Organizing tasks (grouping, categorizing, filtering, searching)
- Deadline tracking
- Urgency indicators (visual urgency through color schema)
- List view of tasks
- Interactable links and relevant information which the user can add to their dashboard
- GitHub Integration (import tasks from Issues and PRs)
- GitHub SSO Integration for Authentication to the Dashboard
- The Rubber Duck (a chatbot specialized for [rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/))
