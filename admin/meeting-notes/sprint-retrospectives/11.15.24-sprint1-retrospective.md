## Member Self-Retrospective
David & Charles:
- What went well
    - Pretty efficient
    - An hour or so meeting with clear objectives
    - Light tasks 
- What didn’t go well
    - Trying not to use CLI on Cloudflare but can’t, had to go back
    - Wanted to design more (focus on design first instead of jumping to building)
    - Everything from source to dist, just go from source
    - Need documentation
- Anything you need help with going forward?
    - Standardizing source code structure, testing, documentation

## General Discussion
- Integrated testing? -> test locally -> write PR -> if validated
- Use tool that David and Charles is using
- Specified person for integration testing
- Take unit tests and integrate with pipeline
- Future goals: integration testing + linting
- Keep track of which projects?
- Write tasks in
- Github auto-populate

## Outcomes
- Mid-sprint updates (Wednesdays): send a message in Discord that says where you stand on your sprint tasks (nothing fancy just a quick message to keep team on same page)
- Standardize versions of tools being used (JS E2023)
- Make sure to keep documentation which could be read and understood by anyone - code should not be written without a robust documentation document to accompany it
- Standardize unit test tool - Jest
- Standardize code practices and implement into pipeline
- Integration testing will be written and maintained by a singular person to ensure consistency
- Need front end and GitHub integration team to meet to solidify what is needed from GitHub API + what should be shown on front end
