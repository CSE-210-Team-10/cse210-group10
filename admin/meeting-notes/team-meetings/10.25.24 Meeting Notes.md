# 10.25.24 Meeting Notes

- Due Dates:
  - 10/29: initial thoughts -> leaning to greenfield
  - 11/6: pitch and start development/design
    - Before: sound reasoning and some design
   
- Greenfield favored over brown
- Pros vs Cons
  - Substantial changes vague for brownfield
  - Chance of failure for green -> broken deliverable

- Potential technologies:
  - Python backend:
    - FastAPI
    - Flask

- Greenfield options:
  - Dashboard or journal options favored 
    - Take inspiration from GitHub issues and improve on them:
    - Instead of branches, put commits as part of issues
    - Trillow replication?
    - Journal integrates with dashboard
  - Journal:
    - Template on what to include instead of blank
    - Abstract comments
    - Create own template (for own team, org, etc)
  - Dashboard (mess):
    - Leaning towards dashboard
    - Talk about issues about current tools that we use
    - Metrics (figure out relative metrics for a developer)
      - Github metrics not very useful for individual dev
    - PR assigned to you
    - Integrate with GitHub or? 
    - Jira, dashboard for github and/or jira
    - Github milestones:
      - Group of issues
    - Modularity: should work on phones as well -> more design work

    - Features Brainstorm:
      - Tags
      - Priority/severity
      - Centralized place to show issues and specific information
      - Issues, PRs, assigning priorities, alerts/notifications, personal sticky notes, figure out more if needed
      - Looking at issues someone else is assigned to
        - Know what else someone is doing and progress
      - Integrating good pieces from different platforms into our project
        - Email integration: integrating messaging platforms
        - List of apps: gmail, slack, etc
        - Summarizing and throw into dashboard -> lots of work though
          - Use of AI for summarization
        - Filter by content:
            - Backend handles computation
            - Frontend fetch
        - Local cache for offline uses?
        - Assignment of hours
        - List of projects/epics youâ€™re involved in
        - Gantt chart, task duration and completion
          - Highlights overdue tasks
          - Some basic chart -> dashboard visualization
- Features Priority
  - Gantt Chart
  - Ticketing/Issues
    - Assigning personal priority, deadline, who is reviewer/owner of issue, tags, add your idea of how long tasks are going to take
  - Notification Service
    - Send emails/notifications from dashboard on impending tasks
  - Personal Sticky Notes feature on dashboard
  - Why Greenfield
    - Experience from tinyfoot with difficulty of integration on features
    - Brownfield has more constraints on what type of features and takes time to understand a codebase and refactoring takes time
