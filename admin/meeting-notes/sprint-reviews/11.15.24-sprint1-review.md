# 11.15.24-sprint-1-review

## Member Presentation
David and Charles:
- Simple pipeline
- Assumption: first iteration only frontend work
    - Sample HTML/CSS/JS vanilla
    - Start live server
    - No database logic
- Have an idea on how to incorporate backend
- Main Objective: main branch release and development
    - All development work on dev branch
- Pipeline: run test -> if good, create environment on cloudflare and deploy there (everyone reviewing PR can go there to check it out)
- Once every day merge
- Create simple environment in CI, CD
- Unit tests in Jest

Matthew & Sammed
- How to integrate with GitHub API
- Have working API code from current GitHub for project
- Unauthenticated - no access token
    - 60 calls per hour
- Added error handling

Kayla and Sravanthi
- Worked on wireframe
- Basic HTML frontend
- Github tutorial, upcoming deadlines look

Shayan and Meghana:
- Set up GitHub
- How to track issues 
- Documentation on ADRs, formatting (issues, PRs, etc)
- Mainly admin so consistency across members

## Questions
- Why cloudflare:
    - Different solutions to host (containers, etc)
    - Selected static bc we do not need to run containers/vms
    - Github.io, cloudflare
    - Deploy on github webpage?
    - Not github: only support hosting production code, push to main and host that
        - Want staging env, no way to do that
        - No way to preview of every PR
        - Creating another repo and pushing it there -> weird, tedious
    - Cloudflare:
        - Not native, but can use CLI to dynamically create new deployment
        - Just run npm build
        - CDN, servers almost everywhere
        - Easier to add backend 
- Merge to main from production is automated?
    - PR to release to main automatic? 
        - No, not yet
        - Need to set it up
        - Can set up timer
- When is pipeline live?
    - Finished test pipeline today
    - After todayâ€™s meeting
    - Validation testing and style checking (linting)
    - Reformatting needs more work
        - Can research if want
- Figma model, when is done?
    - See screenshot for details
    - Make sure guidelines followed
        - Accessibility
- Similar to what professor talked about?
    - Simple design with dummy
- Considerations
    - Want easy to use URL
    - Will question why use cloudflare
    - Consider overhead 
    - Integration testing

## Summary

### Sprint Tasks Completed
David & Charles: Basic CI/CD pipeline implemented

Sammed & Matthew: Learned call limit for GitHub API and managed to pull information from current repo

Kayla & Sravanthi: Updated wireframe design, began work on front-end barebones outlined model, and began Figma model

Shayan & Meghana: Completed ADRs for major decisions made after pitch, created guidelines for naming conventions, organized repo, set up issues and sprint/project tracking

### Outcomes
- ADR for Cloudflare decision over github.io
- ADR for aspects of CI/CD pipeline (why they are there/use case)
- Additional development for CI/CD pipeline will include integration testing and linting
- Automated deployment will be implemented for CI/CD pipeline
