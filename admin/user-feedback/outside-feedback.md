# User Feedback from a Friend Outside of the Class
- Don’t like the scrollbar for tasks - too thick
- The idea of calendar view seems unnecessary; isn’t it repetitive?
- Dark mode for forms not working - bug found
- Overall the theme looks good
- Don’t need entire day of the week for weekly view - just use Mon, Tues, Wed
