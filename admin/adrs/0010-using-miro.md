# Using Miro for Design Organization

## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed a way to organize the design phase of the project.

## Considered Options

* Miro
* Various markdown and Word Documents

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Miro", because the team preferred unification of the documentation and having a visual representation of interacting components of the design will make it easier to ideate once the implementation phase starts.
