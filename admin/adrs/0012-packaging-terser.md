# Using Terser for Package Automation

## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed a way to automate packaging / bundling for production.

## Considered Options

* Terser
* Don't use package automation

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Terser", because it is a minifier that shrinks variable names, removes whitespace / comments, and drops unused code, saving the team a lot of time fixing these issues.
