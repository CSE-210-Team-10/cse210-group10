# Choosing Multi-Page Application (MPA) Architecture

## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed to decide whether to follow the multi-page application (MPA) or single-page application (SPA) architecture for the dashboard.

## Considered Options

* SPA
* MPA

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MPA", because it has lower initial load times, higher scalability due to the modularity of the pages, and, since there are only two pages, the reduction in performance speed is not as problematic.
