## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed to decide the best way to lint Javascript files as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
## Considered Options

* ESLint
* JSLint

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "ESLint", because ESLint provides full support for latest JavaScript/ES6+ as well as ES module system support, whereas JSLint provides no customization options.
