# Removing StyleLint from the CI/CD Pipeline

## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed to decide the if all the linting tools were truly necessary.

## Considered Options

* Remove StyleLint
* Keep StyleLint

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Remove StyleLint", because the team's CSS code was not extensive or complex enough to warrant excessive linting so time could be saved by scrapping StyleLint.
