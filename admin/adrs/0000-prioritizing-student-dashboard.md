# Prioritize Student Dashboard

## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed to decide between which dashboard to choose: student or developer. Each dashboard type had a user persona associated with it and different features based on the user problems and needs.
## Considered Options

* Student Dashboard
* Technical Developer Dashboard

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Student dashboard", because the team decided to prioritize ease of access to users that could test and give feedback on the dashboard. Additionally, the lack of student dashboards in existence motivated the team to attempt to develop a novel solution.
