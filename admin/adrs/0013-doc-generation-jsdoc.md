# Using JSDoc on VSCode for Document Generation via Human

## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed a way to generate documentation for our code so that others could easily understand it.

## Considered Options

* JSDoc
* Other alternatives documentation.js, ESDoc, etc.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "JSDoc", because it is well-documented and supported, requires no compilation, makes it easier to document and read the team's code, and is the basis for alternatives like documentation.js and ESDoc.
