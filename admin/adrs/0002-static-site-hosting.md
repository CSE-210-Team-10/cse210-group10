# Deploy as Static Site

## Context and Problem Statement

The team had to decide how the dashboard would be deployed.
## Considered Options

* Static Site Hosting
* Virtual Machine (VM)
* Container

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Static Site Hosting", because the dashboard has a simple enough frontend and backend that the team does not require the computational power of a virtual machine or a container.
