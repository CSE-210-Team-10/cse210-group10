# Using Cypress for Integration/E2E Testing

## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed to choose a tool for integration / end-to-end testing.

## Considered Options

* Cypress
* Playwright
* Nightwatch.js

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Cypress", because it does not require a web server to run, is easy to use and set up, universal, has a large and active community, and quickly executes tests.
