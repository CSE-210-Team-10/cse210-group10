# Using Figma for Initial Design

## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed a way to visualize the design more formally than the wireframe sketches. This included ensuring that spacing and interaction felt natural. Additionally, the team placed emphasis on accessibility in the color schema.

## Considered Options

* Figma
* Balsamiq
* Penpot

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Figma", because the set up time will be shorter given that the team has experience with Figma. The team will focus on only doing visual work in Figma, and as such reduce the complexity to ensure timely delivery of an initial design.
