# Use of Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS for Front End

## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed to choose how to build the front end.

## Considered Options

* Vanilla Options
* React

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Vanilla Options", because the team could not justify using React outside of having used it previously. All tasks could be accomplished with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.
