## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed to decide the if all the linting tools were truly necessary.

## Considered Options

* Remove HTMLHint and StyleLint
* Keep HTMLHint and StyleLint

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Remove HTMLHint and StyleLint", because the team's HTML and CSS code was not extensive or complex enough to warrant excessive linting so time could be saved by scrapping HTMLHint and StyleLint.
