# Using Jest for Unit Testing

## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed a way to conduct unit tests to ensure high code quality.

## Considered Options

* Jest
* Mocha
* AVA

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Jest", because the team found that compared to the other options, it had stronger documentation, more active community support, great performance, auto mocking, and an extended API not requiring additional libraries.
