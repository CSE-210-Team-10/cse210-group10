The team needed to decide the best way to lint CSS files as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
## Considered Options

* StyleLint
* W3C Validatior

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "StyleLint", because StyleLint can enforce consistent conventions and automatically fix syntax issues, while W3C Validator lacks default local integration and customization options.
