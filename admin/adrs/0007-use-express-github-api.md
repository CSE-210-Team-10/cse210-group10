# Use Express Package for GitHub API Interface

## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed a clean and functional method to perform logging and asynchronous calls to the GitHub API.

## Considered Options

* Express
* NestJS

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Express", because NestJS had additional complexities which this project did not need. NestJS is optimal for scalability and higher complexity applications while Express has faster set up time and works better for our limited application.
