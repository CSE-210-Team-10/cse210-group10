# Prioritize Features Into Tiers

## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed to decide which features to prioritize as "must-haves" and "nice-to-haves". The considered options lay out the features considered for these.

## Considered Options

* Group/categorize tasks based on classes (folders of tasks); filter out tasks in calendar and list
* Show upcoming deadlines for all tasks (NOT grouped, tagged maybe)
* Highlight urgent deadlines (within x days, today, etc.)
* Include relevant information to each task during the creation (e.g. links to instructions, descriptions)
* Import GitHub issues/PRs as tasks (use access token for security?)
* Calendar feature to show tasks in month/weeks
* Search Engine/Chatbot to look for tutorials for specific tools like git

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Options 1-5 "Must-Have", Options 6-7 "Nice to Have"", because the team prioritized features necessary to make a functional dashboard. Beyond this, features which added convenience or utility were added to the "nice-to-have" section.
