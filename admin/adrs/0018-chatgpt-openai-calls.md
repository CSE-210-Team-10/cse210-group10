# Using ChatGPT through OpenAI calls to API

## Context and Problem Statement

The team needed to decide how to implement the rubber duck chatbot for our dashboard.

## Considered Options

* ChatGPT through OpenAI calls to API
* Open source LLM models like Groq gemma or Llama

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "ChatGPT through OpenAI calls to API", because the team had significant difficulties making Groq gemma and Llama work without hosting it on a backend server and the team decided that it was sufficient, given the scope of our project and the remaining time, to simply make calls to the ChatGPT API.
