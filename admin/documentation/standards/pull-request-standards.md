# Pull Request Standards

This document will detail the guidelines for pull request naming and formatting.

## Naming

Pull requests must be named in the following format:

```
descriptor-developer
```

Where "descriptor" is a short description of the changes contained in the pull request and "developer" is the developer who is creating the pull request.

## Content

A pull request must detail the specific work done. The format should be as follows:

```
Feature/Change Description: {fill in here / okay if bulleted list below}

Developer Contributions: {fill in who worked on what}

Dependencies {fill in any features that are dependent on these changes and any special considerations that need to be made because of this}
```
