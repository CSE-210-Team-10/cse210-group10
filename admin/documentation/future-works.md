# Future Works
### Given more time, here are some future directions we would have taken with this project:

- **Dark mode addition for chatbot page**: We were not able to finish dark mode for the chatbot. A future work would be to fully finish this feature.

- **Chatbot session memory**: A future work would be to store the memory of the chatbot session so that the chatbot can recall previous conversations on load and better assist the user.

- **Editing the “Upcoming Deadlines” weekly view**: A future work would be to make this section two-rowed for aesthetic purposes, as described in [this issue](https://github.com/CSE-210-Team-10/cse210-group10/issues/178).

- **Adding calendar view**: Despite us choosing not to proceed with this view, we do think it would be a nice addition to the dashboard to have a monthly or even yearly view of tasks to be completed. A future work would be to implement this view.

- **Optimizing for mobile use**: A future work would be to optimize the interface to work on mobile, which would be extremely helpful if a user does not have their laptop nearby.

- **Adding more accessibility options**: A future work would be adding more accessibility options such as text-to-speech and screen readers.
